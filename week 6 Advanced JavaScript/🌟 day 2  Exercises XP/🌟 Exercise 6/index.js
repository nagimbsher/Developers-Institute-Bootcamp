// In this exercise, you have to decide which type of variables you have to use (ie. let or const):
let bankAccount = 0;
// Create a global variable called bankAmount which value is the amount of money currently in your account.

const vatRat = 0.17;
// Create a variable that saves the % amount of VAT (In Israel, itâ€™s 17%).
// Create an array with all your monthly expenses, both positive and negative (money made and money spent).
// Example :
 const details = ["+200", "-100", "+146", "+167", "-2900"]
// Create a program that modifies the expenses (ie. the positive AND the negative expenses) so that they will include taxes (multiply each expense by the VAT).
// Display your current bankAccount standing at the end of the month.
const currentBankAccount = addvat(details);
console.log("currentBankAccount:",currentBankAccount); 

function addvat(expense){
    let total = 0
    expense.forEach((expense)=>{
        const numExpense = Number(expense);
        const expenseWithVat = numExpense *(1+vatRat);
        total = total + expenseWithVat;
